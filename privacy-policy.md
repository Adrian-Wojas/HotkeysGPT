# Privacy Policy for HotkeysGPT

Last updated: 15 Jan 2025

## Overview
HotkeysGPT ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what information it collects and how it uses it.

## Information Collection and Use
The Extension collects and stores the following data:
- User-defined keyboard shortcuts
- Template text associated with each shortcut

This information is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage sync API, which allows the data to sync across your Chrome browsers when you're signed in.

### Keyboard Activity
The Extension monitors specific keyboard combinations (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Key) only on ChatGPT domains (chat.openai.com and chatgpt.com) to trigger the hotkey functionality. No keystroke data is stored or transmitted.

## Data Storage
All data is stored locally using Chrome's built-in storage API. The Extension:
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Does not use any third-party services
- Does not share any data with any third parties

## Data Access
Your stored shortcuts and templates are:
- Only accessible to you
- Only accessible through your Chrome browser
- Only used for the Extension's core functionality

## Updates to This Policy
I may update this privacy policy from time to time. I will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
